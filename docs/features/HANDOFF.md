# Chuck — Implementation handoff

**Live agent state.** Settled state through 2026-10-14 is archived in
[`HANDOFF-through-2026-10-14`](../archive/state/HANDOFF-through-2026-10-14.md).
Follow [`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md).

## Current position

- **Release:** `v0.16.0` published 2026-10-14 (Latest): release CI run 38593397312 passed and
  the GitHub Release carries the archive, `install.sh` and `manifest.json`; body set from
  [`RELEASE-v0.16.0-notes.md`](../archive/state/RELEASE-v0.16.0-notes.md). Manual provider gates
  below remain owed.
- **Main CI red on UI flakes:** CI runs 38514607452 and 38593397065 on `main` failed only in the
  UI suite: `NewAgentModal` (1–2 cases) and the phone `AgentScreen` successive-gap test, all
  listed as known flaky below. Every `main` push now risks a red CI until they are investigated. Range `v0.15.1..v0.16.0`: the shipped
  `operating-chuck` Think Tank reference now names the discussion `pass` disposition and the
  quiet-round ending; nothing else agent-facing.
- **Repository:** `AsaphNoam/Chuck`; branch `main`.
- **Known risk (unchanged, uninvestigated):** runtime `SetSessionConfig` holds `as.mu` across its
  provider call while `onNotification` takes `as.mu` for unmatched frames on the synchronous read
  loop, so an adapter notification sent before that reply could stall it.
- **Design prepared/TBD — subscription quota views:** FS-09.R80–R81/A49–A50,
  TS-04.R89/TS-03.R61. Full passive paired snapshots remain TBD for Claude and Codex; evidence is
  in [`ideas.md`](../ideas.md). Not a ready unit. Do not implement a hidden prompt, command
  parser, login side client or new adapter patch.
- **Paused work:** `migrate-internal-actions-from-mcp.md` remains paused on its transport blocker.
- **Source-build Go tests:** run with `CHUCK_RUNTIME_ROOT` unset; an inherited installed bundle
  violates a credential test's source-build assumption.
- **Known flaky checks (uninvestigated):** `internal/server`
  `TestOrdinaryStageAgentStopPausesPipelineRun` intermittently returns 409 “a resume is already in
  progress”. `ui` `NewAgentModal.test.tsx` fails 1–2 cases intermittently. `FileViewer.test.tsx`
  “scrolls to and marks a cited line” failed once in the full suite and passes alone. The phone
  successive-gap test can time out when the UI suite runs alongside browser load.
  `internal/server` `TestQuotaDispatcherContinuesSameConversationOnce/stopped` failed once
  (“reloaded transcript differs”, FTS5 variant) in the `v0.16.0` closure run; 40 isolated runs,
  30 `-race` runs and a full FTS5 package rerun pass. Range commit `9989fb88` touched ACP update
  routing; whether it relates is uninvestigated.
- **Fix model:** trivial/easy — Claude Sonnet or Codex Luna (no open fixes).

## Active change

None.

## Acceptance gates still owed

- **FS-20.A22–A24 / TS-13.R30:** paired iPhone Home Screen app and Android browser
  background-return journey (stalled stream, outage, revoked pairing). Simulated/browser proof
  passes; the device suspension cause is still unreproduced.

- **FS-03.A67 / TS-04.R92:** live Claude/Codex permission-mode receipt. Claude 0.59.0's mode
  option is source-checked only; the Codex mode shape is unverified.

- **FS-01.A28:** bounded packaged/installed Claude/Codex terminal-quota and owner-activation
  provider receipt. Current Claude SDK 0.3.286's bare numeric reset declaration has no verified
  producer-unit receipt; Codex forwards no typed reset. Both remain unknown and unscheduled.
  Known-reset state/fake-provider/browser proof is not live-provider reset or delivery evidence.
- **FS-14.A50 / FS-21.A31:** bounded packaged Claude/Codex Think Tank stage probe (start → fresh
  participants → judge → accepted output → next stage). Fake-provider E2E and the 318-check render
  pass are not live receipts. **FS-14.A49** restart/race matrix and **FS-21.A32** live Stop-cancel
  race remain planned.
- **FS-21 / TS-06.R33:** credentialed Claude/Codex Think Tank smoke covering room read/submit,
  addressed input, approval/denial, private Send/Steer, native resume, end-only judge, and retained
  exact result. Fake-provider journey and automated/race closure passed; live receipt is owed.
- **FS-10.R25/A14 / TS-02.R41:** supervised disposable-real-home cutover rehearsal with receipt.
- **FS-02.A46 / A27:** real-browser toast and macOS notification clicks; six-tab shared-stream,
  J14 real-browser, and Sky & Grove with Codex capabilities.
- **FS-14.A54:** packaged Claude/Codex probe that a standing owner/dedicated coordinator adopts
  shared orchestrator instructions; fake delivery capture is not a live receipt.
- **FS-18.A12/A13:** six manual role scenarios and role-free follow-ups on pinned Claude/Codex;
  credentialed fresh/resumed Claude native-preset adoption (pinned adapter 0.85.1 only proves
  the `_meta.systemPrompt` request, not live adoption).
- **FS-20.A1/A5/A6/A8:** real tailnet, Android, iPhone, and `pmset -g assertions`; iPhone Home
  Screen PNG touch icon is absent. The combined 390px dashboard/project/agent-management/Files/
  Commands-retired journey remains owed; fast-mode picker and Continue on approval pause remain
  outside the fake-provider coverage.
- **TS-06.R21:** credentialed Claude/Codex login/chat.
- **TS-06.R31 / FS-09.A40/A42/A46/A47/R78 / FS-10.A10–A12:** finite four-combination provider
  smoke (each provider with current Bundle and one current Installed CLI), plus Installed update →
  Refresh → model and missing Installed → Bundle → retry → Installed-with-overrides journeys.
  Claude Installed fresh launch passed 2026-10-05; the broader credentialed matrix is owed.
- **TS-06.R26/R32:** credentialed Codex 2.1.1 receipt for FS-03.A41/A42 and FS-01.A20.
- **TS-06.R32:** two-point Claude/Codex smoke on ACP 0.85.1/2.1.1 and Codex 0.159.3, one notice,
  Steer during a running command, and refused model switch where policy allows. Automated assembly,
  fake-runtime, release-CI assembly, and native-provider proofs passed; live receipts are owed.

## Decisions needing input

- Whether to standardize TS-03.R3–R4 mixed legacy error envelopes or TS-04.R3 provider model-ID
  ownership (compatibility change).
- Whether a pipeline stage paused after failed launch/resume continues withholding **Open agent**,
  matching restart recovery, or permits chat under a wider continuation contract.

## Design consistency notes

- Next presentation review: decide whether crisp asymmetric technical-surface radii are deliberate
  under FS-12.R52.
- When direct-action work resumes, align TS-01.R25/TS-03.R32 with TS-04.R40 and scope FS-17
  section 6's opening sentence to the planned boundary.
- Injected-steer lifetime edge case needs `/investigate-bug` before `/fix`; FilesTab still copies
  silently through bare `writeText`.
- The phone agent header still repeats the model as text under the name now that the model
  switch shows it above the composer.

## Review findings

None.

Closed reviews through the `v0.16.0` cut are in the archive above.

## Blocked on human

The published `v0.11.0` release body remains empty; its notes are in
[`RELEASE-v0.11.0-notes.md`](../archive/state/RELEASE-v0.11.0-notes.md).
Editing that older release is separate publication work.
